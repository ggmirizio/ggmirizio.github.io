## <span style="color:  "black";"> Bio</span> 
<br>
I am a 3rd year Molecular and Developmental Biology PhD student at Cincinnati Children’s Medical Center studying cell fate determination in the context of human development. My research focuses on how epigenetic modifiers interact with pioneer transcription factors to control lineage-specific genes during endoderm differentiation. In our lab, we use a hybrid approach by combining wet and dry lab work to better understand the mechanisms that control gene expression during development and disease.
